## Covid-19HealthCare App

## ABOUT
It is a door to door Covid-19 testing android app which can help to prevent the transmission of corona virus to other people as the patient doesn’t need to travel to the hospital for getting tested for covid-19 and instead the doctor or other medical assistants will visit the patient’s home for testing purpose. The doctor will add the name and sample id of the patient to register the patient. The app will automatically get the latitude and longitude of the patient while registering the patient. The latitude ang longitude can later be used to represent the patient on the map to mark the safe and risky zones for other people’s reference, if the patient is found to be positive for covid-19 test.
